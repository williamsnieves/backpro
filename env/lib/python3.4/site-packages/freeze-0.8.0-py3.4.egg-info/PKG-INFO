Description: 
        ATTENTION: I now have enough experience to design clean interface for freeze.
        So if there is no bugfix version, the next version will break things.
        
        * freeze_fast will become freeze (because only cycle free datastructures can
          truely be frozen
        * freeze becomes dump, freeze_stable becomes dump_stable
        -> Their purpose is unit-testing or dumping for analysis
        -> There will be an option to select unit-test or dump mode
        
        Freeze the state of data-structures and objects for data-analysis or testing
        (diffing data-structures). Frozen data-structures consist of only tuples
        and these are comparable/sortable/hashable. The freeze method can be used
        for many purposes for example implement __hash__ for your complex object
        very fast. freeze_stable and flatten are usable for testing and analysis.
